1. 	Hibernate?
	Hibernate ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping. This is a mapping tool mainly used for converting data stored in a relational database to an object. This tool also helps in data retrieval, creation, and manipulation.

2. 	Advantages of Hibernate over JDBC?
	Hibernate helps in eliminating a lot of JDBC API-based boiler-plate codes.
	It provides implicit transaction management.
	Hibernate provides HQL which helps in writing database independent queries. while in JDBC, this is not the case.

3. 	Important interfaces of Hibernate framework?
	Configuration
	SessionFactory
	Session
	Criteria
	Query
	Transaction

4. 	What is a Session in Hibernate?
	A session is an object that maintains the connection between Java application and database. Session also has methods for storing, retrieving, modifying or deleting data from database using methods like persist(), load(), get(), update(), delete(), etc.

5. 	What is a SessionFactory?
	SessionFactory provides an instance of Session. It is a factory class that gives the Session objects based on the configuration.
	
6.	“session being a thread-safe object”?
	No, Session is not a thread-safe object which means that any number of threads can access data from it simultaneously.
	
7. 	Can you explain what is lazy loading in hibernate?
	Lazy loading is mainly used for improving the application performance by helping to load the child objects on demand.
	since Hibernate 3 version, this feature has been enabled by default. It means that child objects are not loaded until the parent gets loaded.
	
8. 	First Level Cache
	This is local to the Session object and cannot be shared between multiple sessions.
	This cache is enabled by default and there is no way to disable it.
	The first level cache is available only until the session is open, once the session is closed, the first level cache is destroyed.

9. 	Second Level Cache
	This cache is maintained at the SessionFactory level and shared among all sessions in Hibernate.
	This is disabled by default, but we can enable it through configuration.
	The second-level cache is available through the application’s life cycle, it is only destroyed and recreated when an application is restarted.
	
	If an entity or object is loaded by calling the get() method then Hibernate first checked the first level cache, if it doesn’t find the object then it goes to the second level cache if configured. If the object is not found then it finally goes to the database and returns the object, if there is no corresponding row in the table then it returns null.
	
10.	Hibernate Configuration File?
	Hibernate Configuration File or hibernate.cfg.xml is one of the most required configuration files in Hibernate. By default, this file is placed under the src/main/resource folder.
	The file contains database related configurations and session-related configurations.
	Hibernate facilitates providing the configuration either in an XML file (like hibernate.cfg.xml) or a properties file (like hibernate.properties).
	
11.	How do you create an immutable class in hibernate?
	Immutable classes in hibernate can also be created by using @Immutable annotation.

12.	What is criteria API in hibernate?
	Criteria API in Hibernate helps developers to build dynamic criteria queries on the persistence database. Criteria API is a more powerful and flexible alternative to HQL (Hibernate Query Language) queries for creating dynamic queries.
