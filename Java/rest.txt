WEB SERVICES
* It is a technology to communicate one application with another irrespective of programming language.
* It is a way to achieve interoperability.
* Request is input to webservice while response is output to webservices.
* Service provider is the one that host web services and Service consumer is the one that consumes that web services.
* Transport means how the services is called? Is the service exposed over the internet(HTTP) or queue(MQ).

SOAP
* It uses xml to create webservices.
* The structure of soap contains envelope, header(optional) and body.
* Soap services can be exposed over HTTP or MQ.

 REST(Representational State transfer)
To connect to the weather service we can make a rest api call over http.
It is lightweight approach for communicating between applications.
REst is language independent.
Client and server can use any programming language.
Rest application use any data format.Commonly see xml and json(Javascript object notation). json is most popular and modern.
Http request contains header, body and method. while Http response contains response with status code.
Rest services can be exposed over HTTP only.

JSON
* Lightweight data format for storing and exchanging data ... plain text.
* Langugage independent ... not just for javascript.
* Can use with any programming language: java,c#, python etc...
*Data bindinng is the process of converting json data to a java pojo. Also known as mapping , serialization/deserialization, marshalling/unmarshalling.

Jacskon data binding
*Spring uses the jackson project behind the scenes.
*Jackson handles data binding between json and java pojo.
*By default, jackson will call appropriate getter/setter method.So if we are converting from json to pojo, it will call our given setter method and vice versa. 
*When building spring rest applications, spring will automatically handle jackson integration.
* JSON data being passed to rest controller is converted to pojo, and java object being returned from rest controller is converted to json atuomatically. 
* We can ignore json unknown properties by adding the @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown=true) on the POJO.

Rest over Http
* Most common use of rest is over http.
* Leverage Http methods for crud operations are :
Post - Create a new entity.
Get - Read a list of entities or single entity.
Put - Update the entity.
Delete - Delete the entity.
*Client send httprequestmessage to the server.
Http Request Message contains request line:the Http command, header variabels: request metadata, Message body: contents of message.
* Server send http response message to the client.
Http response message contains response line:server protocol and status code, header variable:response metadata, message body: contents of message.

Http response status codes
code range	Description
100-199		Informational
200-299		Successful
300-399		Redirection
400-499		Client error
500-599		Server error

MIME Content Types
*The message format is described by MIME content type- Multipurpose internet mail-extension.
*Basic syntax: type/sub-type
*Example:text/html, text/plain(it is for browser.info returned to client so client render it accordingly)
	 application/xml, application/json,...
(it is for restful client)

Spring MVC provides support for spring rest.New Annotation is @RestController. It is an extension of @Controller. It handles rest request and response.

Web browser vs postman
For simple rest testing for get requests, web browser and postman are similar.
However, for advanced rest testing post, put etc..., postman has much better support.
Posting JSON data, setting content type. 
Passing HTTP request headers, authentication etc...

Rest exception
Define exception handler methods with @ExceptionHandler annotation.
Exception handler will return a ResponseEntity.
ResponseEntity is a wrapper for the HTTP response object.
ResponseEntity provides fine-grained control to specify:HTTP staus code, HTTP headers and  Response body.
@ControllerAdvice is similar to interceptor/filter.It pre-process requests to controllers. Post-process responses to handle exceptions. Perfect for globle exception handling. Ex-when we apply same exception on multiple controllers.

Interview Questions

* How does data exchange between application takes place?
With the help of request and response.

* How can we make web services platform independent?
We can makes the request and response platform independent by using data exchange format like xml or json.

* How does the application know the format of request and response?
By providing service definition which contains request/response format, request structure, response structure and endpoint.
