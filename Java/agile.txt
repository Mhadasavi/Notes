Agile

- Agile simply means continuous incremental improvement through small and frequent releases.
- There are two different roles in an Agile methodology. These are the Scrum Master and Product Owner.
	1. Scrum Master
	The Scrum Master is a team leader who removes all the blockers that occur related to devs or projects etc.
	2. Product Owner
	They collects requirement from stakeholder that represents the client and prioritize them and adds into the backlog.
- Backlog contains features, bugs fixes/enhancements. It must be in ordered by priority and business value.
- Backlog items are input to the sprint to be implemented and added to an increment.

- Product owner creates the User stories of different tasks and categorize them into sprint.
- Scrum Master assigns those User stories to devs.
- Devs will analyze those stories and share their estimates.
- Devs will start their work on the stories and deployed on the Qa server for testing.
- QA will test them and share the status with product owner.
- Once the given User stories of sprint are tested and working fine, it will deployed to UAT and prod.
- In case any story left in the sprint, it will shift to the next sprint.
