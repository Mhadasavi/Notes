- Product owner creates the User stories of different tasks and categorize them into sprint.
- Scrum Master assigns those User stories to devs.
- Devs will analyze those stories and share their estimates.
- Devs will start their work on the stories and deployed on the Qa server for testing.
- QA will test them and share the status with product owner.
- Once the given User stories of sprint are tested and working fine, it will deployed to UAT and prod.
- In case any story left in the sprint, it will shift to the next sprint.
