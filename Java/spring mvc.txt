1. What is Spring MVC?
It is a design pattern which is used to create web application.
In this, browser sends the request to front controller.
front controller delegates the request to controller.
Controller calls the business logic and return the model data to front controller.
Front controller sends this model data to view template (jsp or other).
jsp returns this data as a response to the browser.

1. What is the front controller class of Spring MVC?
The DispatcherServlet class works as the front controller in Spring MVC. It delegates the request to the controller.

2. What does @Controller annotation?
The @Controller annotation marks the class as controller class. It is applied on the class. A controller handles the request, calls the business logic and place data in models.

3. What is model?
It contains data which is return to the viewtemplate. It could be java object or collection.

4. What is viewtemplate or view?
In spring, we commonly used jsp+jstl for views. Views read the data from the model and display it.

5. What does @RequestMapping annotation?
The @RequestMapping annotation maps the request with the method. It is applied on the method.
We can also apply it on controller, in that case it serves as a parent mapping for controller.

6. @RequestParam("") String name;
It reads the request parameter form data and binds it to the variable

7. What does the ViewResolver class?
The View Resolver class resolves the view component to be invoked for the request. It defines prefix and suffix properties to resolve the view component.The org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver class is widely used.

8. FormTags
It is used for data binding. It automatically set/get data from java objects.
ex- form:form, form:input, form:checkbox, form:select etc.
To use this, we need to specify spring namespace at the beginning of jsp file.
<%@ taglib prefix="form" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags/form" %>
