    Using microservices, we don't have to scale our whole application.
	This allows each component to easily scale with tools like Kubernetes in case of high demand.

	to measuring project estimation, it is important to give estimation in man-hour. 
	A man-hour defines the amount of work done by an average IT specialist during one hour worked without any interruption.
